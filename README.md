# Project: Turlututu

### Description
As part of my development training, I was asked to create a website reproducing the layout of this image [Turlututu-original-image] (https://github.com/FrankZiWANG-dev/Turlututu/blob/main/turlututu.png?raw=true).

### Technologies used
Using Ubuntu on the Windows Terminal, the Notepad program, as well as the web browser, I created the html and css files and code necessary. I then uploaded everything onto my Github and created a Github page. You shouldn't need anything special to read the page.

### Roadmap
I first created the repository, added an html branch to lay out the structure and a css branch to work on the appearance (with corrections to the html code added).
I used a color picker to match colors, but the police detection tools did not work. Appearance might not match 100%, element size may vary a little.
I did not add the text boxes either, as I lacked some time to do so.

### Author
"I maked this" alone, but with the guidance of my Becode Coach and fellow students.

### Extra information
The original image is taken from the Becode repository for our assignments. This is just an exercise, so you probably won't have to reach out about any questions or support.
